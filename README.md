# Kaggle Competition Scripts in R

This repository hosts translations of high-scoring Python scripts from Kaggle competitions into R. The initiative focuses on popular machine learning models like XGBoost and LightGBM, including data wrangling processes, tailored for R users.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide R equivalents for Python-based machine learning models that have demonstrated success in various Kaggle competitions. This assists R users in leveraging advanced data science techniques more common in Python environments.
